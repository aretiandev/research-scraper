TODO:

DONE 0. correct bug that was not collecting groups and projects because it was skipping the first line. Then re-run everything to get author_links and get authors. (this was left running overnight)

1. Build networks.
2. Get departments from IGTP by using the information on their website.
3. Calculate additional KPIs (number of papers, books, etc)
4. Color networks by department
5. Check if isolated nodes are important. If they are we might need to recalculate edges based not only on joint publications but also affiliation to same department.
6. Expand definition of projects and groups to use as colors in the visualization.
