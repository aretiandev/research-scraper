TODO:

DONE 0. correct bug that was not collecting groups and projects because it was skipping the first line. Then re-run everything to get author_links and get authors. (this was left running overnight)
- Check if this completed running.

1. Redo networks with the new nodes data that includes the correct research groups and projects.
2. Get departments from IGTP by using the information on their website.
3. Recalculate KPIs (groups and projects) and add additional: books vs papers.
4. Check if isolated nodes are important. If they are we might need to recalculate edges based not only on joint publications but also affiliation to same department.
5. Expand definition of projects and groups to use as colors in the visualization.
6. Get startups from DNB.
