TODO:

1. correct bug that was not collecting groups and projects because it was skipping the first line. Then re-run everything to get author_links and get authors. (this was left running overnight)
2. Get departments from IGTP by using the information on their website.
3. Color networks by department
4. Calculate additional KPIs (number of papers, books, etc)
5. Check if isolated nodes are important. If they are we might need to recalculate edges based not only on joint publications but also affiliation to same department.
6. Expand definition of projects and groups to use as colors in the visualization.
