# TODO:

## Update researcher-level networks

DONE. Correct bug that was not collecting groups and projects because it was skipping the first line.

RUNNING. Re-run everything to get author_links and get authors.

- Nodelist: Recalculate number of groups and number of projects

- Nodelist: Add number of publications by type to nodelist

- Redo networks with the new nodes data that includes the correct research groups, projects and type of publication.


## Create Research Group networks

- Expand definition of projects and groups to use as colors in the visualization.

- Get startups from DNB.


## OTHER

- Get departments from IGTP by using the information on their website.

- Check if isolated nodes are important. If they are we might need to recalculate edges based not only on joint publications but also affiliation to same department.


## OTHER 2
 Finish downloading missing DNB startups.


## NOTES:
Problem:
- Running the scraper from JupyterLab or directly from a script produces different results. 
Solution:
- This is actually because JupyterLab is inside in a Docker container. If you run the script from inside the docker container you get identical results.
